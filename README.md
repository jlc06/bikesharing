# Citi Bike Research
## Overview
### Purpose
After an exciting trip to New York City with my friend Kate, we started looking through photos and realized how big an impact the use of Citi Bikes had on our experience. Following a discussion, we decided we wanted to explore the possiblity of starting our own bike sharing company in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.
